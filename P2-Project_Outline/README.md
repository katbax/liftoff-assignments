## Submission Instructions

### Overview
  My project will be called EatUp!. It will be an interative application that will allow users to compile all of their favorite recipes in one central place. The idea came from my current interest in gathering meal prep recipes. They currently sit in my bookmarks with no real sense of order. I thought about how nice it would be to have one central place that would allow me to search by ingredient. 
  The EatUp! app will primarily be a place where a user can store recipes. These recipes will be publicly available to the other users of the app, if they so choose. The publicly available recipes will be searchable by ingredient. There will also be an optional feature whereby user can enter nutrition information such as calories, fat, protein, and carbs. There will also be optional tags to identify dietary restrictions such as vegan, gluten-free, etc. These tags will be pre-set.

### Features
1. Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page that consists of their recipes in chronological order.
2. Search: Users will be able to search for recipes based on the provided ingredient and tag.
3. Create Recipe: Users will be able to create new recipe pages when logged in. New recipes will appear in the userâ€™s profile in chronological order.

### Technologies
1. C#
2. ASP.NET Core
3. MySQL
